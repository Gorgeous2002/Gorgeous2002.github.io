Hi, I'm Qin Zhao, senior undergraduate student from School of Automation, Xi'an Jiaotong University. I will pursue my Ph.D degree in Zhejiang University, , co-supervised by [Prof. Bo Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KNWTvgEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dahua Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GMzzRRUAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interest lies on Human-centric Intelligence, including Generative AI and Embodied AI.

We introduce TeleOpBench, the first standardized benchmark for evaluating dual-arm dexterous teleoperation systems. This work addresses a critical gap in robotics research by providing a fair, reproducible platform for comparing different teleoperation approaches. Our benchmark features 30 high-fidelity manipulation tasks ranging from simple pick-and-place to complex bimanual coordination, and implements four representative control modalities including motion capture, VR controllers, exoskeletons, and vision-based tracking. Through extensive validation on both simulated and real robot platforms, we demonstrate strong correlation between virtual and physical performance, establishing TeleOpBench as a valuable tool for advancing dexterous manipulation research.
